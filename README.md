You need Phonegap and NPM to make/build this project

Currently only builds iOS, to build android just add Android to platforms in the gruntfile.

First resolve all dependencies with node package manager (Installs grunt and bower):
  `npm install`

Resolve all web dependencies with bower (backbone.js and require.js):
  `bower install`

User the gruntfile to install Cordova plugins, create folders and build.
  `grunt init`
